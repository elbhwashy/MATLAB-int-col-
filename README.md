# MATLAB-int-col-
Write a function called int_col that has one input argument, a positive integer n that is greater than 1, and one output argument v that is a column vector of length n containing all the positive integers smaller than or equal to n, arranged in such a way that no element of the vector equals its own index. In other words, v(k) is not equal to k for any valid index k.
